Thesis title: Detection of Appearance-Based Tweets Mentioning U.S. Politicians with fastText and VADER

This thesis investigates the differences in how female and male politicians are referred to in regard to their physical appearance on Twitter. For this, we propose a new experimental method to estimate the amount of appearance-based language that is present called Scoring Appearance with fastText (SAFT). Additionally, we do an analysis to determine how the sentiment (positive, neutral or negative) is expressed in the tweets.

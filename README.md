#Thesis title: Detection of Appearance-Based Tweets Mentioning U.S. Politicians with fastText and VADER

#The purpose of this thesis is to investigate how people talk when mentioning political figures to find out if there is a difference the way female and male politicians are referred to in regard to their physical appearance on Twitter. For this, we propose a new experimental method to estimate the amount of appearance-based language that is present.
